###The Web is Awesome

We love the web.  It’s the bedrock of innovation so sprawling, “genius” might describe the idea to monetize LOLcats.  It’s 24/7 vigilance upwelling the support of millions to the aid of earthquake victims.  It’s websites whose off-button have the power to change national policy.  It’s where a college student’s virtual yearbook terrorizes Wall Street.

***"You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world [wide web]." — Morpheus***


We’ve all indulged in the hypnotizing, infinite scrolling of Facebook posts, only to frantically close the window as a passerby reminds us of our stupor.  We’ve spent hours crafting the perfect post or looking for the meme that will win the most likes.   But, something is missing.  

### We are building Facebook & Twitter’s website

Facebook.com and Twitter.com are mighty empires, but they’re just someone else’s website.  Like serfs, with every post & tweet, we are building out Facebook and Twitter’s website.

###We’ve had the Internet long enough to start taking our lives on it seriously.

Perhaps you’re among those [leaving Facebookistan](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/05/leaving-facebookistan.html) looking for a less despotic domain, perhaps you’re among those itching to exercise some digital citizenship.  The elusive truth is that it's not about technology, it’s not about being the next billionaire, it's about us. It’s about being the one who will tell the story and the one, coming back from the city in the cloud, who helped to make it.  How did we ever come to doubt that our technology is an extension of ourselves?


###Your website should be the hub of your digital life

Your web presence should start with your site on your domain.  The godfather of the the Internet, [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/2011/01/10/own-your-data/) thinks so.  

The guys creating HTML5 and CSS3 are saying things like;

"Your site should be the source and hub for everything you post online. This doesn't exist yet, it's a forward looking vision..." - [Tantek Çelik](http://tantek.com/2011/010/b1/owning-your-data)

It has been prophesied;

"There will come a time in the not too distant future where having a website will be considered a birthright.”

It’s a no-brainer.  The information we share is becoming exceedingly important, and even critical to our livelihood.   You should post all content you are creating on your site and syndicate out to silos like Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, etc..  That way you can use your data more effectively to whatever end, even profit from it.  Think about it.  You can't even search old tweets!  WTF!  

###It’s time our websites conform to us

Technology is for humans, not the other way around.  Changing our habits is not the solution, changing technology is.  Few of us want to build a website.  It’s time the-same-thing-we-are-doing on Facebook and Twitter just so happens to result in an awesome website - because all we are doing is sharing our information.  It’s time that a web presence stops becoming work and becomes an addiction with a greater meaning than a sophomoric social game.  It’s time you own land on the Internet and use it to - start a movement, grow a business, share ideas, whatever.  The purpose in life, within the Internet and without, is to become.

###Websites are like tablets pre-iPad, they suck, they need dramatic simplification

If you’re here, you probably own a few domain names on GoDaddy, but where do you turn to put something up?  The problem is that a good-enough solution does not exist.  The following are symptoms of the lack of a solution that is good-enough to solve this problem:

-Investing 10,000 hours in earning the technical chops required for a DIY solution
-Wasting days in labyrinths of admin panels trying to get an image from messing up the text around it or just post a freaking youtube video
-Getting a blog, realizing you need a butt-load of plugins, then uh oh, realizing adding a shopping cart is damn near impossible
-Lost and looking for a place to build a home on the fractured landscape of social media
-Neglecting the formidable ‘content management system’ because even the act of logging in is too much work
-Completely forgoing a solution because it seems too hard and too expensive
-Assuming you wouldn’t actually use a website, but continuing to build and help manage Facebook and Twitter’s website

Like tablets, websites would be life-changing-benefactors-of-awesome if they just worked and got out of the way.  Like tablets, hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into awkward non-integrated solutions.  Like the iPad, we are committed to the first awesome product in our category.

Hello world!
