#Decentralize The Web


>"You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world [wide web]." — Morpheus


Increasingly, our lives are being [digitized](http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000119312512222368/g287954g47m63.jpg). Our personal information lives in the internet and our relationships are fostered and maintained through online interactions. Our friendships, community, public identity, interests are all mapped out on the internet. The barrier that separates the real world from the digital world is fading.

##What is the Problem?

Do you even know where your infomation is stored? It is uploaded and stored somewhere in **centralized servers or “cloud services” – a term that should be used as a euphemism.** — [echelon](http://www.soa-world.de/echelon/2011/09/the-decentralized-web-movement.html). And someone, not you, holds the key to all of your information. You are at the mercy of the gatekeepers, the **middlemen who control the servers of the world.**

***

##Who are the Gatekeepers?

You know who [they](http://dangerousminds.net/comments/facebook_i_want_my_friends_back) are, and they don't have your best interest in mind. Go to any media outlet and you can see reports of privacy or [contract breaches](http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/24/tech/social-media/instagram-class-action-suit/index.html) having to do with your personal information, your livelihood!

You sign a contract with the gatekeepers only to find that the contract changes. Just look at [Facebook's Eroding Privacy Policy Over Time ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline). You trusted the gatekeeper with your most important information only to find that the corporation’s social contract is one sided.

As [The New Yorker's Steve Coll](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/05/leaving-facebookistan.html#ixzz2J13ElLff") put it:

>"Through its bedrock appeals to friendship, community, public identity, and activism—and its commercial exploitation of these values—Facebook is an unprecedented synthesis of corporate and public spaces. The corporation’s social contract with users is ambitious, yet neither its governance system nor its young ruler seem trustworthy."

Now that we know the world as it is, let's talk about the world as it should be.

##Decentralize the Web

The solution is in changing the centralized architecture of the internet. **Decentralize the Web** is not a new idea, it has been [tried and failed](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2009/06/16/thoughts-on-opera-unite/), but this time it's different. This time, it's personal for everyone.

Decentralize the Web is a movement that challenges you to take back your digital information, and own it on ***YOUR MACHINE, ON YOUR ACCOUNT, ON YOUR TERMS***

##Own Your Content

Your website should be the hub of your digital life. Your web presence should start with your site on your domain. The godfather of the the Internet, [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/2011/01/10/own-your-data/) thinks so. 

The guys creating HTML5 and CSS3 are saying things like;

"Your site should be the source and hub for everything you post online. This doesn't exist yet, it's a forward looking vision..." - [Tantek Çelik](http://tantek.com/2011/010/b1/owning-your-data)

It has been prophesied;

"There will come a time in the not too distant future where having a website will be considered a birthright.”

It’s a no-brainer.  The information we share is becoming exceedingly important, and even critical to our livelihood.   You should post all content you are creating on your site and syndicate out to silos like Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, etc..  That way you can use your data more effectively to whatever end, even profit from it.  Think about it.  You can't even search old tweets!  WTF!

##Websites Need Dramatic Simplification

Websites are like tablets pre iPad, they suck, they need dramatic simplification. For most, getting a website up is easier said than done. Where do you go to get your website? The problem is that a good-enough solution does not exist.  

The following are symptoms of the lack of a solution that is good-enough to solve this problem:

- Investing 10,000 hours in earning the technical chops required for a DIY solution
- Wasting days in labyrinths of admin panels trying to get an image from messing up the text around it or just post a freaking youtube video
- Getting a blog, realizing you need a butt-load of plugins, then uh oh, realizing adding a shopping cart is damn near impossible
- Lost and looking for a place to build a home on the fractured landscape of social media
- Neglecting the formidable ‘content management system’ because even the act of logging in is too much work
- Completely forgoing a solution because it seems too hard and too expensive
- Assuming you wouldn’t actually use a website, but continuing to build and help manage Facebook and Twitter’s website

Like tablets, websites would be life changing benefactors of awesome if they just worked and got out of the way.  Like tablets, hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into awkward non-integrated solutions.  Like the iPad, we are committed to the first awesome product in our category.

##Websites Should Conform to the Users

Technology is for humans, not the other way around. Changing our habits is not the solution, changing technology is. Few of us want to build a website. It’s time the same thing we are doing on Facebook and Twitter just so happens to result in an awesome website.

It’s time that a web presence stops becoming work and becomes seamless. It’s time you own land on the Internet and use it to start a movement, grow a business, share ideas, anything.

##A New Vision for the Website

So, today, we're introducing a revolutionary product, that enables, for the first time, for you to become, to have a home on the Internet.  

A new vision for the Website, we invented a design technology that’s revolutionary b/c with a Single input, you get a massive output. facebook page → boom → website. Any feed of content → boom your website. You can even add products too.

Throw any type of content in, and the website designs itself to fit the content, and it designs itself according to the rules of the masters of design. No instructions required, and of course, it works on your iphone & ipad.

By reinventing the website, we created a new experience of the Internet.

##New Experience of the Internet

Because it's not just about you & your website, the internet is a connection machine! It's about every website, it's about the connections between websites & connecting people behind those websites. So, we invented a new way for your websites to be hubs in the connection economy, piping information to & from any website, and more importantly, we laid the piping for humans to make meaningful &  financial connections through websites.       

We took the Internet and sprinkled on top of it a new kind of social commerce.

##New Kind of Social Commerce

Even with the hottest Twitter profile, the most liked instagrams, we still need to provide for our families. All this time spent socializing, can now help create revenue or fund a movement. Look, just within your social circle, there is enough value for all of you to quit your jobs. We’ve had the Internet long enough to start taking our lives on it seriously.  

So, an epic new vision
